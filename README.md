# ML-Log-Normalization-Capstone-Project-with-Splunk

This repository summarizes my work on data normalization using ML for my capstone project with Splunk, a Cisco company. The project was to create a prototype of a machine learning model to automate translation of Zeek logs to a new framework, OCSF (Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework). 

> **Note:** The actual project code is proprietary and private, so this repo contains only a high-level overview.

## My Role & Contributions

- Developed Python scripts to automate translating log data into OCSF format in order to make training data, created 5 out of 17 translators for various Zeek log types.
- Integrated unit tests to ensure every OCSF log translation pipeline met 100% of OCSF required standards.
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams to ensure seamless test deployment and data collection.
- Created a transformer model prototype using the BERT model as a base.
- Tuned hyperparameters with WandB, a hyperparameter optimizer.
- Oversaw code documentation

## Technologies & Tools Used

- Python (scripting and automation)
- Pytest (test framework)
- Pytorch (ML modeling)
- WandB (Weights and Biases, hyperparmeter tuner)
- Git (version control)

## What I Learned

- Building translation pipelines for log information.
- Building robust, maintainable test automation frameworks.
- Collaborating effectively in a fast-paced, cross-disciplinary engineering team.
- Engaging with companies to iterate and refine prototypes aligned with user and business needs.
- Leveraging Git for branching, merging, and resolving conflicts in a multi-developer environment.
